    <h2 class="burgers">Description</h2>

    <p>An easy recipe for smash burgers. Can be cooked on stove top or on grill. Can also be paired with any side you like.</p>

    <h2 class="burgers">Ingrediants</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck (80/20)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Cheese, any kind you choose</li>
        <li>Brioche buns, buttered and toasted</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice</li>
        <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>A few dashes of liquid smoke</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="burgers">Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix butter, worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke in bowl</li>
        <li>In another bowl place beef and pour the butter, worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke mixture on top of beef</li>
        <li>Gently break up beef and gently mix thouroughly</li>
        <li>Once mixed, make 3-4oz balls and cover the burger balls with plastic wrap until ready to cook</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until SUPER HOT. Drop a tiny sprinkle of water to test it, if it immediately sizzles and bounces around and disappears, it’s ready. No need to add oil, there’s plenty of fat in the burger. Remove your burgers from the fridge or freezer and sprinkle them with kosher salt and pepper. Place about 3 to 4 balls in the skillet, leaving room for them to be smashed down. After 30 seconds of searing, smash them all the way down until they can’t be smashed anymore, with a large heavy skillet. Leave them alone and let them cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, or when the edges start to turn brown. Flip them over and immediately place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. When the cheese melts, they’re ready, about 1 to 2 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Build your burger with the toppings of your choice and enjoy!</li>
